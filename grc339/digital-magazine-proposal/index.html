            <h3>A Sip Away</h3>
            
            <p>“It tastes like grass.” That's a sentence commonly heard from many who drink matcha for the first time. I remember when people would hate on the drink and question the people who drank it. Now it’s a very popular drink that can be found in every cafe or boba shop. It has become such a huge part of our pop culture but what caused this sudden shiift? In this digital magazine, we are going to discuss what factors played in the rise of the popularity of matcha.</p><!--Short description of the magazine-->
