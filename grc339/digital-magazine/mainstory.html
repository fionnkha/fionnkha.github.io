            <h2>‚òÅÔ∏è Going Viral</h2>
            <p>Matcha‚Äôs story begins in Japan, where it was first embraced by Zen Buddhist monks more than 800 years ago. Its vibrant green powder, made from finely ground shade-grown tea leaves, was valued for sustaining long hours of meditation. Over time, it became central to the Japanese tea ceremony, symbolizing mindfulness, respect, and tradition. For centuries, matcha remained a cultural treasure, consumed quietly in tea houses, celebrated for its artistry, and appreciated as a ritual rather than a trend.

            <p>In the 21st century, matcha began its journey onto the global stage. The rise of wellness culture coincided with growing curiosity about ancient superfoods, and matcha fit perfectly into the movement. Packed with antioxidants, offering calm, sustained energy, and boasting a unique earthy taste, it appealed to health-conscious consumers looking for alternatives to coffee. At the same time, caf√©s in cities like New York, London, and Los Angeles began experimenting with matcha lattes, desserts, and fusion recipes‚Äîintroducing the tradition to a new audience that valued both health benefits and novelty.
